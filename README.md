0-10V DAC / ADC / RS485 and OLED Arduino Shield
===============================================

This is a simple board to be able to 
- Generate 4 0-10V analog output to drive industrial devices
- 2 0-10V analog input (unprotected) 
- A RS485 Driver (use RX/TX of Arduino)
- 2 I2C Oled connector (Adafruit or Tindie Oled)
- 1 Rotary Encoder
- 1 WS2812B RGB Led

This is a proto board, I've just ordered one on OSHPark, will put 
more details once received and tested
